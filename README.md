Capstone Project: Pokedex

Please let me know if this is too ambitious and if I should resubmit a more simplified mockup.

You can customize UI color of your pokedex to the color associated with your fave type of pokemon: fire, electric, psychic. etc
Pokedex color is currently set to Dragon Type

I don't know if possible, but might be cool to make animation of pokedex flipping open???
I know you can CSS rotate in 3D space

I want the pokedex to appear this way in all screen sizes, simply scaled to the device, but no UI changes.

Will try to code the D Pad to use WASD keys or Arrows.
